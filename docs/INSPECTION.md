# Inspection — 2026-09-25

Dated audit record (like evidence, not a queue): test-suite review for
"tests for the sake of tests" plus a redundancy/overengineering pass over
the runtime modules, requested by the user. Scope: main @ 887443c +
engineering-slices working tree. Method: per-file metrics (lines / tests /
expects / mocks) over all 112 unit files, full reads of the smallest and
mock-heaviest files, dead-export scan over `src/core`, `src/UI`,
`src/Utils` cross-referenced against production, test and script
consumers, and consumer checks for every suspect module.

## Actions taken (same commit as this file)

Removed production API that nothing but its own test consumed, and the
tests that existed only to exercise it:

- `routePage.isCurrentPage` — dead convenience predicate (production reads
  `getCurrentPage()`); its test mirrored "the former dataset equality
  reads", i.e. a removed implementation. Function + test deleted.
- `worldSlots.WORLD_SLOT_IDS` / `worldSlotById` / `isWorldSlotId` — no
  production importer (production uses `WORLD_SLOTS`, `worldSlotAt`,
  `worldSlotIndex`, `WORLD_SLOT_COUNT`). The invariant tests now assert
  through those production-owned lookups; the "lookup by id round-trips
  every slot" test was redundant with the strict-index-lookup tests and
  was deleted.
- `brandTokens.BRAND_TOKEN_NAMES` — no production consumer; the Less-parity
  test now derives the names from `BRAND_TOKENS` locally.
- `storyState.StoryState` — interface referenced by no production code
  (`CinematicNav` consumes the pure functions + `StorySide` only); the
  "story state shape" test only re-combined two already-tested pure
  functions to satisfy it. Interface + test deleted.

Deduplicated test scaffolding (no coverage change):

- The identical manual-loop renderer double and jsdom pointer-capture
  shims existed in 9 declarative `TresCanvas` test files. Single source
  now: `src/__tests__/tresHarness.ts` (`createRendererMock`,
  `installCanvasPointerShims`). Net ≈ −170 lines.

Suite delta: 695 → 692 tests, all 112 files green; `tsc`, `vue-tsc`,
`eslint` (0 errors), `prettier` clean.

## Checked and found sound

- No tautological or mock-only tests found. The mock-heavy files
  (`SceneCoordinator.motionParity`, `ExperienceUI.lifecycle`,
  `Experience.rendererRecovery`, `Experience.destroyOwnership`) assert
  documented contracts: reduced-motion gating, demand-driven updates,
  once-per-pass owner snapshots, disposal ownership.
- Paired test files are layered, not duplicated: `*.test.ts` (Vue
  declarative mount) vs `*.lifecycle.test.ts` (class contract) cover
  different owners of the same object (GroundPlane, CinematicLights,
  WorksStageOwner etc.).
- Per-stage lifecycle tests assert each class's own disposal
  implementation (shared-geometry release, borrowed materials, uniform
  isolation, late-call immunity) — not the shared `LazyStage` mechanics,
  which have their own dedicated suite.
- No dead runtime modules: every flagged module has production consumers
  (`FrameGapStats`, `RuntimeResourceSnapshot` → DevPanel/renderer
  diagnostics required by the phase7 evidence gates; `toneMappingGuard`
  → both post pipelines; `routeContinuation`, `worksExperience`,
  `worldSlots`, `types.ts`, `UIManager` — all consumed).
- Exports flagged as "tests-only" but used inside their own module
  (e.g. `makeRendererDisposeIdempotent`, `canTransition`, `escapeXml`,
  `supportsPostProcessing`, `BRAND_TOKEN_PREFIX`) are the
  exported-for-testing pattern, kept deliberately.

## Observations left open (no action, recorded honestly)

- `Experience.ts` (~88 KB) remains a god-class owner. Splitting it is an
  architectural project, not hygiene; AGENTS preserves the current
  architecture and the migration audit found its ownership contracts
  sound. Revisit only if a concrete defect or the NEXT queue demands it.
- `docs/evidence/` payloads accumulate historical reports (~40 phase7
  JSON files). They are preserved by protocol; if growth becomes a
  problem, an archival decision belongs to the user, not a cleanup PR.
- The 2026-09-17 audit already closed the earlier duplication findings;
  this pass found no new dead files or duplicate GPU owners.
